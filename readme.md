Tutorial : [VSCode Docs - Build and Run Python in a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/quickstart-python)

## What I learned

Initial experience in setting up a project that will be using Python and Django that will be hosted in a Docker Container. The tutorial goes through and teaches the basic starting process using the Command Palette of VSCode. 

* Initializing a basic Django project
* Using the command palette to add Docker files to project
* Building the Docker image using the command palette
* Running the newly built Docker image(service container)
* Attaching the Debugger to the container executing code and debugging
* Where to find the container logs

## Next step(s)

* Practice these steps to understand the workflow
